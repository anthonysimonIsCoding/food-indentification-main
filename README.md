# Neural Network Model

We use a neural network model for image classification. Specifically, a pre-trained ResNet-18 on ImageNet is employed to classify images of Vietnamese cuisine dishes.

ResNet-18 is a deep convolutional neural network designed for image classification tasks. It consists of multiple convolutional layers, fully connected layers, and other components to extract features from images and predict their labels.
